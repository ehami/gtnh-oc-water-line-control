## Information

Program is designed to automate the water line from T1 to T8 water. 
Program is modular, you can choose which water types you want to automate.
It is also possible to send messages to Discord about out of service situations.
And there is also the possibility of auto update at startup.
The program can be configured to self-regulate and optionally operate as a single-threaded water line if desired 
(this is the main improvement over the base Navatusein/GTNH-OC-Water-Line-Control).

### [QC] Quantity Controller

#### Components

To build a setup, you will need:
- ME Interface on your main or fluid network: 1
- Adapter: 1

#### Description

This module allows autostocking based on the stored fluid levels. There are multiple control modes:
- `"disabled"` - No quantity control. Tier controllers are unmanaged and run continuously.
- `"multiThread"` - Basic quantity control. All tier controllers with a water level below their threshold will run. 
- `"singleThread"`
  - Based on the wiki's [Single Threaded Waterline](https://wiki.gtnewhorizons.com/wiki/Water_Line#Singlethreaded_Waterline). 
  - This only runs one tier at once, allowing 100% utilization of your power supply and increased parallels (which is especially relevant for generating Stabilised Baryonic Matter, which is based on T8's parallel count). 
  - This runs the lowest tier that is below its threshold.
- `"singleThreadBalancing"` - Similar to `"singleThread"`, but will attempt to balance stored quantities by tier. To ensure parallels are not wasted, there is a minumum quantity value that should be set to the largest water quantity used in a single waterline cycle (ie, max parallels * 1000).

TODO: Currently, the quantity controller does not maintain a fluid level for Stabilised Baryonic Matter. This would be a useful modification.

#### T1 Config part

```Lua
config.quantityController = QuantityController:fromConfig({
  baseConfig = config,
  controlMode = "singleThreadBalancing", -- "disabled", "multiThread", "singleThread", "singleThreadBalancing"
  meInterfaceAddress = "a1b2da71-b742-466f-86ce-dc8614756c1d",  -- Address of the ME Interface on the main/fluid storage network that should be monitored
  minQty = 32000,  -- The minimum quantity that will allow higher tiers to run. Set this to the highest amount used in a single cycle (which is based on the configured parallels). Only applies for controlMode="singleThreadBalancing". 
  waterThresholds = {
    -- Amount of each water to keep stocked (in L). Ignored if controlMode = "disabled"
    64000, -- T1
    64000, -- T2
    64000, -- T3
    64000, -- T4
    64000, -- T5
    64000, -- T6
    64000, -- T7
    64000  -- T8
  },
})

### [T8] Subatomically Perfect Water (Grade 8)

#### Components

To build a setup, you will need:
- Adapter: 2
- Transposer: 1
- MFU: 1

#### Description

To use the module for t8 water in the `config.lua`
You must also specify the address of the transposer in the `transposerAddress` 
field, which is located under the hv input bus and to which the interface with the Quarks connected.
Also the address of the adapter connected to me interface in the `subMeInterfaceAddress` field.
Also in the configs you can change the number of quarks the computer must support in this field ` maxQuarkCount`.
There you need to specify the number of quarks that are in the subnet. So if you put 7 quarks of each type in the subnet. 
3 will go into the interface, then you need to specify 4. Because that's how many are left in the subnet.

The controller is connected via MFU to keep it accessible.

The idea is that a separate subnet is made for quarks. The Absolute Baryonic Perfection Purification Unit returns unused quarks and 2 
Unaligned Quark Releasing Catalysts after crafting is complete. The computer looks to see which quarks are less than the specified 
number (`maxQuarkCount` in the default configs is 4) and orders them. That is, the subnet must have at least 2 CPUs and a 
Hyper-Intensity Laser Engraver connected to order quarks. It is possible without a subnet, but the condition is that the computer can order quarks. 
Stabilized Baryonic Matter can be fed into the subsystem or directly into the Laser Engraver.

> [!NOTE]  
> Maximum 42 infinity ingots used per cycle. But usually less. Consumption can be 6, 18, 42 ingots per cycle. Depends on luck.

#### T8 Config part

```Lua
t8 = { -- Controller for T8 Subatomically Perfect Water (Grade 8)
  enable = false, -- Enable module for T8 water
  controller = t8controllerLib:newFormConfig({
    maxQuarkCount = 4, -- Maximum number of each quark in the sub AE
    transposerAddress = "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa", -- Address of transposer which provide Quarks
    subMeInterfaceAddress = "aaaaaaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaa-aaaaaaaaaaaa" -- Address of me interface which connected to sub AE
  })
}
```

General configuration in file `config.lua`
The configuration of water line modules is described in paragraph [Water Line Setup](#water-line-setup).

Enable auto update when starting the program.

```lua
enableAutoUpdate = true, -- Enable auto update on start
```

In the `timeZone` field you can specify your time zone.

In the `discordWebhookUrl` field, you can specify the Discord Webhook link so that the program sends messages to the discord about emergency situations.
[How to Create a Discord Webhook?](https://www.svix.com/resources/guides/how-to-make-webhook-discord/)

```lua
logger = loggerLib:newFormConfig({
  name = "Water Line Control",
  timeZone = 3, -- Your time zone
  handlers = {
    discordLoggerHandler:newFormConfig({
      logLevel = "warning",
      messageFormat = "{Time:%d.%m.%Y %H:%M:%S} [{LogLevel}]: {Message}",
      discordWebhookUrl = "" -- Discord Webhook URL
